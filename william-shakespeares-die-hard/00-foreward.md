# From the Author

Did you grow up a reader?
I did.
I was one of _those_ kids in school who always had a book in hand.
Those kids who actually looked forward to the arcane language of Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_.
Those kids who giggled aloud at  the Wife of Bath or Mercutio rambling on about Mab.

I picked up my first Shakespeare in middle school, reading _Romeo and Juliet_ before ever seeing it performed or hearing it read.
Our teacher sent us home to read a scene at a time, and I was so excited to come in and read aloud select dialogues she wanted to highlight.
It's etched permanently into my memory as one of my most embarrassing moments: pronouncing it _Mon-tawg_ instead of _Mont-ag-yoo_ because what 14-year old would look at similar words like Prague and think to pronounce Montague any differently?

I was also one of those kids who went on to play Claudio in the local community theater's production of _Much Ado About Nothing_.
But the less said the better about my acting abilities.

Fast-forward a few decades to Ian Doescher's _William Shakespeare's Star Wars_ series and I was again hooked.
I bought the trio of hardbacks for Episodes IV-VI, but it wasn't until I got a chance to hear the audiobooks performed that I would know that I had to try something similar.
Choosing _Die Hard_ was initially a whim, but the more time passed the more it just stuck around as a thing-I-could-do.

And here we are.
My authorial skills share little with those of Shakespeare and Doescher, but I hope they at least meet the bar for keeping you amused.
