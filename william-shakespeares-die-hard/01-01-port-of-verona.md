# Act I

## Scene 1.  Venice

> Many anonymous PASSENGERS wander through at intervals.
> Enter GIANCARLO and MERCHANT.
> MERCHANT juggles more bags, boxes, and articles than can be managed by one person.
> GIANCARLO has no luggage and is silent, unsure of his surroundings.
> MERCHANT drops everything and curses loudly. 

**MERCHANT**

    My dreams again exceed my meager reach.
    Each box, each bag, is nothing to the eye.
    Yet Sisyphus I am beneath their sum.

> MERCHANT sees GIAN from behind.
> He is about to call for aid when GIAN turns and we see a conspicuously large sword at his belt.
> MERCHANT shrinks and returns to his wares.
> GIAN takes a deep breath, coughs on the foul air, and shrugs as if giving up on his observations and notices the MERCHANT for the first time.

**GIAN**

    Good sir!

> He moves to help.

        Sincere apologies for my
    Indifference to your plight, as I was but
    Remarking on these new surroundings here.
    That scent which lingers on my nose-

> He inhales and again coughs.
> He bends and twists to load packages onto the MERCHANT, who jumps to avoid the sword.
> GIAN notices and backs away, respectful.

    Fear not: 'tis sheathed. Your toes shall not depart.
    It has drawn blood, far more than I care see,
    But it and I, on respite from action,
    Are pledged to help, not harm, for the season.

**MERCHANT**

    A soldier then?  But to be sure, a friend?

**GIAN**

    I do believe it so.  I have family
    In Padua, where my journey does end.

**MERCHANT**

    How fortunate!  For we both must retain
    a skiff to Marghera before sundown.

> They distribute the load between them.

    I thank you for your help, but what of you?
    Where is your kit? If none, at least a pack?

**GIAN**

    'Tis none.  My leave is but a fortnight long.
    Alacrity from here to there necessitates
    Naught but strong legs and unencumbered back.

**MERCHANT**

    I know that tune.  Often a deal presents itself,
    No warning to be seen.  So on the road
    Before the sun I find myself naked.
    A shirt upon my back but not much else.
    It matters not how big my cart if I
    Arrive to find I missed my chance to buy.
 
**GIAN**
 
    In all my years of soldiering, I must admit:
    Never have I gotten used to the march.
    I've not the officer's temperment in me.
    No horse for me, just miles of foot by foot.
    Each step a silent fight 'tween toe and boot.

**MERCHANT**

    Oh ho!  Then may I offer up one word?

**GIAN**

    I'd gladly take any vocal unguent.

**MERCHANT**

    Balls.

**GIAN**

       Balls?

**MECHANT**

    Indeed.  In truth 'tis how my feet survive!

> GIAN looks at him and they stop walking.

    When home I 'rive my feet I bare and stride
    With toes curled up and arches to the sky.

**GIAN**

    Balled toes?  Balled feet?

**MERCHANT**

    You think I jest young sir but I do not.
    Bear fur, or stag, or something soft's the key.
    Then curl, uncurl, and curl, uncurl your toes.
    Without a thought you'll feel the miles melt 'way.

> They resume walking in silence for a beat.

**GIAN**

> Shrugs, resigned.

    Balls.
