## Scene 2: Road to Padua

> ARGELLO, a valet, stands enjoying a pipe beside a luxurious horse-drawn carriage.
> His clothing, while nice, is ill-fitting as his his demeanor.
> Enter GIANCARLO.

GIAN

    Young lad!  Show aid to me and point my way.
    Which road to Padua leads?  But yet, how far?

ARGELLO

    'Tis but a half-day's ride into the sun.

GIAN

    Go you that way?  I must be there tonight.

> GIAN turns to squint and ARGELLO notices the scabbard across his back.
> ARGELLO chokes and extinguishes his pipe.

ARGELLO

    MacLane?  Giancarlo, sir?

GIAN

        -- You know my name?

ARGELLO

    No need to touch your sword, I promise you.
    Sent here to you to save your legs the walk,
    My lord he shares your urgency, and thus
    This horse and cart and me: your Argello.

GIAN

    Your lord sent this for me?


ARGELLO

        -- The Don, Indeed.
    But Officer MacLane, where are your bags?
    Alas, In cabin still aboard the ship?


> ARGELLO opens the carriage door, but GIANCARLO closes it and climbs up the coachman's step.

GIAN

    No need.  Let's go.

> ARGELLO shrugs but climbs up after him.

ARGELLO

    Good sir, are you yet sure you'll not avail
    Your weary bones the luxury and peace
    Beneath the tilt?  The sun's weak rays do naught
    To 'bate the bite of winter's frosty breath.

GIAN

    Four days at sea I hunched in cabin dark.
    Below decks packed in as if a cargo crate.
    I'll take what sun I can as I may,
    Meager though it is.

> After ARGELLO puts the cart in motion the silence is awkward.

ARGELLO

    I fear I cannot press the horses more.
    The feast will be half --

GIAN

        -- Feast? What's this?

ARGELLO

    Three feasts, in truth.

GIAN

    Your jests pierce like the wind.

ARGELLO

    No, sir, the feast is real.  Or three as one,
    Depends upon who's asked.  Christmas Eve, of course.
    And too, for some, Saturn's remembered still.
    But young and old both can agree on one:
    The peace brokered with House Anjou begins today.

GIAN

    Was there war?

ARGELLO

    A war of trade, of goods, of tax, of words.
    No men have died, but fortunes lost for both.
    One noble house of Padua yet stands.
    The Nakatomi coat of arms still flies.

GIAN

    Nakatomi?  What kind of name is this?

ARGELLO

    Don Takagi can to Caesar be traced.

GIAN

    I see.  The name Nakatomi is new
    To these two frost-bit ears.  And House Anjou?

ARGELLO

    The same you know of France along the Loire.

GIAN

    While sure I am a tale of great renown
    Could now be told of hist'ry 'twixt the two,
    I find I care not a flea's weight in gold.

ARGELLO

    Your grumble's not unlike the sleeping bear.
    But hours of lonely road are our shared den.
    'Side me you sit, so comp'ny I must be.  
    Wherefore your long and frigid trek from far?
    A soldier may in many ports find rest.
    Padua may be a sight easy in Spring,
    Fair maids in fields, sun-kissed and fancy free.
    But now?  Winter?  With all in lay'rs of cloaks?
    All Christmas day'd be spent unwrapping one.
    Or do I speak misord'red?  Have you family?

GIAN

    Your assumptions are true, if impertinant.

ARGELLO

    Oh ho!  The grumpy boar has a dam!  Or sow?

GIAN

    A love once lost, through fault of ignorant youth.
    When easier 'twas to follow Mars afar
    Than broker peace 'tween home's Juno and Jup.
    
ARGELLO

    Those lightning bolts are ones I know too well.
    My horse has slept in many a fine stable.
    But not yet found one comfortable next morn.
    Some day, maybe.  For now I still ride free.
