## Scene 2: Road to Padua

> ARGELLO, a valet, stands enjoying a pipe beside a luxurious horse-drawn carriage.
> His clothing, while nice, is ill-fitting as his his demeanor.
> Enter GIANCARLO.

GIAN

    Young lad!  Show aid to me and point my way.
    Which road to Padua leads?  But yet, how far?

ARGELLO

    'Tis but a half-day's ride into the sun.

GIAN

    Go you that way?  I must be there tonight.

> GIAN turns to squint and ARGELLO notices the scabbard across his back.
> ARGELLO chokes and extinguishes his pipe.

ARGELLO

    MacLane?  Giancarlo, sir?

GIAN

        -- You know my name?

ARGELLO

    No need to touch your sword, I promise you.
    Sent here to you to save your legs the walk,
    My lord he shares your urgency, and thus
    This horse and cart and me: your Argello.

GIAN

    Your lord sent this for me?


ARGELLO

        -- The Don, Indeed.
    But Officer MacLane, where are your bags?
    Alas, In cabin still aboard the ship?


> ARGELLO opens the carriage door, but GIANCARLO closes it and climbs up the coachman's step.

GIAN

    No need.  Let's go.

> ARGELLO shrugs but climbs up after him.

ARGELLO

    Good sir, are you yet sure you'll not avail
    Your weary bones the luxury and peace
    Beneath the tilt?  The sun's weak rays do naught
    To 'bate the bite of winter's frosty breath.

GIAN

    Four days at sea I hunched in cabin dark.
    Below decks packed in as if a cargo crate.
    I'll take what sun I can as I may,
    Meager though it is.

> After ARGELLO puts the cart in motion the silence is awkward.

ARGELLO

    I fear I cannot press the horses more.
    The feast will be half --

GIAN

        -- Feast? What's this?

ARGELLO

    Three feasts, in truth.

GIAN

    Your jests pierce like the wind.

ARGELLO

    No, sir, the feast is real.  Or three as one,
    Depends upon who's asked.  Christmas Eve, of course.
    And too, for some, Saturn's remembered still.
    But young and old both can agree on one:
    The peace brokered with House Anjou begins today.

GIAN

    Was there war?

ARGELLO

    A war of trade, of goods, of tax, of words.
    No men have died, but fortunes lost for both.
    One noble house of Padua yet stands.
    The Nakatomi coat of arms still flies.

GIAN

    Nakatomi?  What kind of name is this?

ARGELLO

    Don Takagi can to Caesar be traced.

GIAN

    I see.  The name Nakatomi is new
    To these two frost-bit ears.  But Takagi?
    This name I've seen writ down.  And House Anjou?

ARGELLO

    The same you know of France along the Loire.

GIAN

    While sure I am a tale of great renown
    Could now be told of hist'ry 'twixt the two,
    I find I care not a flea's weight in gold.

ARGELLO

    Your grumble's not unlike the sleeping bear.
    But hours of lonely road are our shared den.
    'Side me you sit, so comp'ny I must be.  
    Wherefore your long and frigid trek from far?
    A soldier may in many ports find rest.
    Padua may be a sight easy in Spring,
    Fair maids in fields, sun-kissed and fancy free.
    But now?  Winter?  With all in lay'rs of cloaks?
    All Christmas day'd be spent unwrapping one.
    Or do I speak misord'red?  Have you family?

GIAN

    Your assumptions are true, if impertinant.

ARGELLO

    Oh ho!  The grumpy boar has a dam!  Or sow?

GIAN

    A love once lost, through fault of ignorant youth.
    When easier 'twas to follow Mars afar
    Than broker peace 'tween home's Juno and Jup.
    
ARGELLO

    Those lightning bolts are ones I know too well.
    My horse has slept in many a fine stable.
    But not yet found one comfortable next morn.
    Some day, maybe.  For now I still ride free.
    Or were you wed?

GIAN

        -- Questions abound from you!

ARGELLO

    Hours more have we behind this horse, so tell:
    Were you yet yoked beside the dam Juno?
    From side to side, she dragged you with her whims?
    Mayhaps your eyes did blacken from her kiss?

GIAN

    Attend the horse and slight me not, young man.

> The two are silent until it becomes awkward again.
> ARGELLO begins to sing.

ARGELLO

    On Christmas Eve came their embrace,
    With masks and silken gown.
    So long apart now face to face,
    Yet to eachoth'r unknown.
    
    A hare she was, long ears of white,
    Her whiskers twitched alertly.
    A tortoise in his shell that night,
    His features hid expertly.
    
    Around and round and front and back,
    The music as their guide. 
    Each dance a partner new, alack,
    Unceasing as the tide.
    
    And yet through cinque pas and spin,
    All songs did end apace:
    Tort and hare locked grin to grin,
    An eth'real embrace.

    With midnight knell the masks were struck
    Which found our creatures scared.
    Old mem'ries did confuse and buck
    The sweetness they'd just shared.

GIAN

    Your wit is quick I must admit, Arg'lo.
    But happiness is hard to build, more so
    When music's gone and words must fill the void.

ARGELLO

    How found you two apart?  Could naught be saved?

GIAN

    She wanted more than I thought she could grasp.
    We grew togeth'r in village small, wherein
    Each face was known and all were seen as friend.
    But bonds as these were ropes restraining her.
    She chafed her wrists against the familiar.
    Never content to settle down at home.
    Her hand was fair at each new task she tried.
    Contentment was the only test she failed.
    One day I saw in eyes of blue a truth:
    The wide Scotland would not hold 'nough anew.
    With heated words I sent her from our hearth.

ARGELLO

    Believing she'd be back by dusk or morn?

GIAN

    Assured so, I thought, two children towed.
    The evening next, with head of mead and wine,
    At home I find she'd stripped it bare by day.
    In drunken rage I left to fortune seek.
    My hand has always held hilt of sword with skill.
    For God I'd smite the evils of this world,
    And drown sorrows in blood instead of drink.

ARGELLO

    A noble cause for sure.  How long at war?

GIAN

    Seven long years with battles more than I can count.

ARGELLO

    In Padua your wife has found a home?

GIAN

    I know not how, but so her letter told.
    Received last month with script and words cautious.
    But still, her truth was honest and laid bare.
    Both grown and tired of war, could there be peace?

ARGELLO

    A lofty goal for all the world to strive.

GIAN

    But what of this Don Takagi?  Who's he?

ARGELLO

    My lord.

GIAN

    You said.  But why would he send you to me?
    My wife mentioned some kind of work for him.
    But vague was that entire page of text.

ARGELLO

    My lord invests and builds in lands afar.
    A bridge, a mill, or e'en new blacksmith forge.
    One part merchant, one investor, I guess. 
    Afraid I am it's all beyond my brain.
    But liked by all in Padua, his trades are fair.

GIAN

    Will I meet him?

ARGELLO

    Tasked I am to put your hand in his.
    As long as we don't freeze afore we 'rive.

> Exeunt.
