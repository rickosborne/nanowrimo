## Scene 2: Road to Padua

> Enter GIANCARLO and ARGYLE in a luxurious horse-drawn cart.
> GIAN sits

ARGYLE

    Good sir, are you yet sure you'll not avail
    Your weary bones the luxury and peace
    Beneath the tilt?  The sun's weak rays do naught
    To 'bate the bite of winter's frosty breath.

GIAN

    Four days at sea I hunched in cabin dark.
    Below decks packed in as if a cargo crate.
    I'll take what sun I can as I may,
    Meager though it is.

> The silence is awkward.

ARGYLE

    I fear I cannot press the horses more.
    The feast will be half-

GIAN

        -Feast? What's this?

ARGYLE

    Three feasts, in truth.

GIAN

    Your jests pierce like the wind.

ARGYLE

    No, sir, the feast is real.  Or three as one,
    Depends upon who's asked.  Christmas Eve, of course.
    And too, for some, Saturn's remembered still.
    But young and old both can agree on one:
    The peace brokered with House Anjou begins today.

GIAN
